	<h3>How to make Lasagna</h3>
	<p>This butter chicken recipe, or chicken makhani, is one of my favorite Indian dishes. it features a full-flaverd sauce that complements the chicken well. It can be made as mild or spicy as you wish by adjusting the cayenne. Serve with basmati rice and naad bread.</p>
